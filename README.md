## PWA & Capacitor

This repository has been prepared with Progressive Web App support and Capacitor configuration so you can build web, installable PWA, and package mobile apps.

Quick commands:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build:web
npm run cap:add:android
npm run cap:sync
npm run cap:open:android
```

For iOS builds you need macOS and Xcode; use `npm run cap:add:ios` and `npm run cap:open:ios`.

Notes:
- `capacitor.config.ts` sets `webDir` to `dist` (Vite build output).
- Service worker and manifest are created via `vite-plugin-pwa`.
